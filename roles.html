        Controllers:
      </section>
      <section class="description">
        In VALORANT, controllers are agents that specialize in using utility abilities to manipulate the battlefield and limit the enemy's field of view. VALORANT controllers are essential in blocking off areas, limiting sightlines, and disrupting the enemy's movements, making them an essential component of any team composition. <br>
        Controllers are often paired with other agent types like Duelists or Initiators to create a well-rounded team.<br>
        VALORANT Controllers have a variety of abilities that allow them to manipulate the battlefield in different ways. These abilities typically fall into a few different categories:<br>
        &#8226; Smokes: Smokes are used to limit an enemy's FOV and prevent the enemy team from seeing your movements. They're essential for controlling areas of the map and can be used both defensively and offensively.<br>
        &#8226; Walls: Walls are used to block off areas entirely and limit the enemy team's movement. They're often used to create chokepoints or force the enemy team to take a specific path.<br>
        &#8226; Other Utility: Some controllers have other types of utility abilities that can be used to disrupt the enemy team's movement or control their actions. These abilities might include stuns, slows, or other debuffs.

        Duelests:
      </section>
      <section class="description">
        There are a total of six Duelist Agents in VALORANT. This class is among the most picked roles in VALORANT competitive games because players find them more accessible than other Agents.<br>
        As the name suggests, Duelists are the ones who would take duels against the enemies and have the tools to frag out most with the support of their team. A unique aspect of a Duelist Agent is that their abilities recharge when they get kills, unlike other characters in the game, which have time-based cooldowns.<br>
        Duelists are self-sufficient Agents and are expected to get the highest number of kills in a match, or at least the highest amount of first kills <br>(or first bloods). However, a good Duelist manages to create space for the team and can take first encounters to secure the area on a map.<br>
        Even if a duelist fails to win a duel against the enemy team but manages to create space for the team or even fake execution to win the round can be a good duelist.

      </section>
      <section class="description">
        VALORANT has a total of 21 different agents, out of which six agents are Initiators. Initiators have the most versatile abilities available to them. These utilities can be used to clear the site while attacking or gather enemy information on the map. Usually, initiators are the one who helps to set up the Duelist to take space and get that important first blood. Initiators can also take individual fights and create space across the map for teammates.
